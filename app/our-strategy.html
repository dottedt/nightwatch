                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>Lower the global rate of neonatal deaths by improving local newborn care for both premature and full-term infants that require medical attention.</p>
                <h3>Our Strategy</h3>
                <ol class="our-strategy">
                    <li><span class="orange-text">Invest</span> in the education of neonatal caregivers</li>
                    <li><span class="orange-text">Procure</span> technology that is effective and appropriate</li>
                    <li><span class="orange-text">Develop</span> a community of caregivers that will advance our cause</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The <span class="orange-text">Nightwatch</span> Foundation will collaborate with institutions that are considered centers of excellence in neonatal care in the region. We will work together with <a href=" https://www.allkids.org/home" target="_blank"> All Children's Hospital</a> Johns Hopkins Medicine in the Central American and Caribbean region.</p>
                <p>To maximize the impact of limited resources and improve the level of care, <span class="orange-text">Nightwatch</span> will leverage a geographical “hub and spoke” approach. This hub will serve as a centralized knowledge center that supports the spokes.</p>
                <p class="padding-bottom">Over time, our goal is that our alumni and associated hospitals will then in turn become “hubs” for their local communities.</p>

                        <p>Newborns will be the immediate beneficiaries from increasing survival rates to reducing the rate of relapses and disabilities. Providing proper local care reduces the stress on newborns and allows for timeliness of care.</p>

                        <p>In addition to having improved care for their newborns, families would also benefit from having local alternatives. Local treatment also can mean less of an expense burden (than receiving treatment in another country) and would allow for proximity to the family’s support network in the area.</p>
